      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hey there! I’m Aziz, but online, I go by SK1LL3R. Cybersecurity is my passion—whether it’s hunting for bugs, diving into CTF challenges, or exploring new ways to defend and attack digital systems, I’m always looking for the next challenge. My journey into cybersecurity started when I became fascinated with how vulnerabilities exist in systems and how they can be exploited or patched up.

Right now, I’m deep into penetration testing, vulnerability research, and developing strategies for both attacking and defending networks. I spend my time on platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box, sharpening my skills, solving real-world CVEs, and learning new tools that help me break into and secure digital systems. But for me, cybersecurity isn’t just about breaking in—it's about building stronger defenses to protect against those who would exploit weaknesses.

Looking ahead, I have big plans. My ultimate goal is to become a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). I want to lead security strategies, ensuring organizations stay ahead of digital threats and protect what matters most. This blog is where I share what I learn along the way—whether it’s writeups, tools, certifications, or just random thoughts about cybersecurity. If you're into this stuff, feel free to reach out, share ideas, or just follow along as I continue this exciting journey.</p>
